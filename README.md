# Sewage-Water-Monitoring-Using-Raspberry-Pi
This project implements a fully automated IoT-based sewage water monitoring system built on Raspberry Pi. It integrates multiple sensors—pH, MQ2 gas, DHT11 temperature/humidity, and ultrasonic level sensors—to continuously evaluate water quality parameters and detect contamination in real time.
